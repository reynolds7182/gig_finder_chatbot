# Gig Finder Chatbot
Template repo for the mini-project assessment on the unit IUI000131 Natural Language Processing for the Creative Industries.

For your assessment you should make a new repository based of this template. Your chatbot class should inherit from the base class `ChatbotBase` and you should write new functions that override the basic functions given in this template.

As you develop your own chatbot you should make regular commits using git to track and save the progress of your work. It is a requirement for you to make at **least 3 commits** to show the progress of your work. 

Your submission for the mini-project will be a link to your own git repo that is based of this template class.
